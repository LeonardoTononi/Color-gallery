# for Multiplica

 **Introduction.**

    This application is made with gatsby, it makes the best use of this technology to be fast and efficient for all members of a team.

  **Framewor used**

    I used Gatsby that is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.

    Also deployed on Netlify. 

  **How to use it after a fork or a download?**

  It's really simple, run the command **`gatsby develop`** and on a browser go to localhost:8000 (is the default port for a gatsby project).
